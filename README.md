![Lint](https://github.com/solareon/slrn_groups/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=standalone)

A group app that provides `qb-phone` compatible exports. This should work with most resources that expect a `qb-phone` style group. This is the standalone branch that does not directly interface with a phone.

**QBOX/QB/ESX/ND/OX supported with bridge**
